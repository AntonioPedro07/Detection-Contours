## Introduction

This repository focuses on contour detection using Python and OpenCV. It provides tools and implementations for detecting and outlining contours in images and video streams.

## Overview 

The goal is to offer a unified platform to explore, test, and compare the performance of various contour detection algorithms across different datasets and scenarios.

## Functionalities

- Implementation and comparison of different contour detection algorithms.
  
- Real-time contour detection from camera feeds.
  
- Pre-processing techniques including thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations.
  
- Visualization of detected contours on images and video frames.

## Configuration

No specific configuration is required beyond standard Python and OpenCV installation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- OpenCV (cv2)

- Numpy
